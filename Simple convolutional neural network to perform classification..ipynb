    "The project focuses on developing and comparing image classification models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, we build a custom CNN model from scratch, train it on a chosen dataset, and evaluate its performance. Next, we fine-tune two pre-trained state-of-the-art models, such as ResNet or AlexNet, and compare their performance with our custom model."

    "The goal of this is to understand the trade-offs between designing a CNN from scratch and using pre-trained models through transfer learning. From this we get a chance to explore key concepts like network architecture, activation functions, optimizers, and overfitting, while analyzing how different models handle image classification tasks."
